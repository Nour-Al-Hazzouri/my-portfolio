# My Portfolio

## Hello world! I'm Nour Al Hazzouri.

**This is my first ever portfolio built from scratch using HTML5 and CSS3.**

## Why did I build it?

I recently completed The Odin Project’s Intermediate HTML and CSS course (full-stack JavaScript path) and wanted a short break to focus on my internship with TechTalks before fully diving into JavaScript. At the same time, I had the urge to test my layout skills, so I figured: “why not build a portfolio?” That’s how this project started.

## How did I build it?

My first challenge was choosing a simple, modern design that matched my current skill level without being too complex. For this, I used **Figma Make**, Figma’s built-in AI tool, which ended up being a huge inspiration for the layout, design, and theme.

You can check the design here:

## What did I use?

I relied on:

* Figma Make (for design inspiration)
* `modern-normalize` to reset Brave’s default styling
* HTML5, CSS3, and my own coding skills
* Google search + debugging
* Git for version control

I used **zero AI for code generation**. The only AI involved was Google’s built-in “AI Mode” to answer questions, nothing more.

## What was the most difficult part?

As the project grew, the hardest part was finding which piece of code was causing layout issues — things like overflowing, spacing inconsistencies, or any visual problems hidden somewhere inside different components.

## What did I learn?

* **CSS Variables rock.** Managing spacing and repeated properties became way easier, even when dealing with responsiveness.
* Responsiveness is not just about media queries. Using `%`, `clamp()`, `rem`, and other units correctly made most components naturally responsive, with media queries coming in to handle specific layout changes.
* Overflow almost always comes from a mistake on my end. Instead of hiding overflow blindly, I learned to find the actual cause.
* Semantics and best practices **matter**. Using meaningful names, semantic elements, clean structure, comments, and a branch-per-feature workflow made the project organized from start to finish. It made debugging easier and allowed me to track progress without feeling lost.

## What does this project mean to me?

A **milestone**. I like keeping my old projects and even merged branches on GitHub to remind myself where I started. I hope that as I keep building more projects over the next 1.5 years (currently a TS2 student), I’ll clearly see my improvement from milestone to milestone.

## Resources
These are the two main learning resources that helped me build the foundations I relied on in this project:

- [Harvard’s CS50x](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)
A computer science course that builds real problem-solving skills. It isn’t focused on web development specifically, but the logic, structure, and way of thinking you gain from it make everything else easier.

- [The Odin Project (TOP)](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
A free, project-based curriculum that teaches web development the practical way. You don’t just read or watch — you build real projects and learn by doing, which is exactly what helped me reach the point where I could build this portfolio from scratch.
